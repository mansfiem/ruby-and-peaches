WHAT IS RUBY PROGAMMING LAUNGAGE?

Ruby is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. It was designed and developed in the mid-1990s by Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto in Japan.
Ruby is dynamically typed and uses garbage collection. 
It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.
According to the creator, Ruby was influenced by Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, BASIC, and LisP.


Its history?

Early concept- Matsumoto has said that Ruby was conceived in 1993. In a 1999 post to the ruby-talk mailing list, he describes some of his early ideas about the language:
I was talking with my colleague about the possibility of an object-oriented scripting language.
I knew Perl (Perl4, not Perl5), but I didn't like it really, because it had the smell of a toy language (it still has). 
The object-oriented language seemed very promising.
I knew Python then. But I didn't like it, because I didn't think it was a true object-oriented language – OO features appeared to be add-on to the language.
As a language maniac and OO fan for 15 years, I really wanted a genuine object-oriented, easy-to-use scripting language. I looked for but couldn't find one. 
So I decided to make it.
Matsumoto describes the design of Ruby as being like a simple Lisp language at its core, 
with an object system like that of Smalltalk, blocks inspired by higher-order functions, and practical utility like that of Perl.

The name "Ruby"- The name "Ruby" originated during an online chat session between Matsumoto and Keiju Ishitsuka on February 24, 1993, b
efore any code had been written for the language.[18] Initially two names were proposed: "Coral" and "Ruby".
Matsumoto chose the latter in a later e-mail to Ishitsuka.[19] Matsumoto later noted a factor in choosing the name "Ruby" – it was the birthstone of one of his colleagues.
